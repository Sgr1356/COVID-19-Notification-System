with Beautiful Soup and Plyer libraries naturally following 1 hour data of Covid-19 will 
showed in windows notice framework

2:how can you show notification:plyer
	windows notification has 2 things 1:title 2:message 3:appicon

3:get data :mohfw.gov.in
4:build soup,web data parse.
definition:
Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents.
 It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML, which is useful for web scraping.
 Prettify() function in BeautifulSoup will enable us to view how the tags are nested in the document.

5:generate notification for states.






issues:

1:plyer package does not support jpg,png etc.. so convert  to ico extension
